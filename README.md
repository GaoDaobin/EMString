EMString
========

EMString for Easy Markup String. 
A simple category on top of NSString to make your life easier when manipulating string with multiple styling. It behaves like HTML. Just use &lt;p>&lt;/p> &lt;strong>&lt;/strong> &lt;em>&lt;/em> ... in your string and it will behave like you expect it to. For those sick of using NSAttributedString!


This is a work in progress :)
